# Project Plan: Letta PHP SDK

## 1. Project Goals and Scope
- **Goal:** Develop a robust, well-documented PHP SDK for the Letta AI Agentic Framework, enabling PHP developers to easily interact with all Letta API endpoints.
- **Scope:**
  - Full coverage of all documented Letta API endpoints (Agents, Tools, Sources, Groups, Identities, Models, Blocks, Tags, Batches, Voice, Templates, Providers, Runs, Steps, Health).
  - Support for authentication (Bearer token).
  - Usable in modern PHP projects (Composer package, PSR standards).
  - Comprehensive error handling and response parsing.
  - Unit and integration tests.
  - Example usage and documentation.

## 2. High-Level Architecture
- **HTTP Client Layer:** Handles requests, authentication, retries, and error handling.
- **API Resource Classes:** One class per major API resource (e.g., Agent, Tool, Source, etc.), encapsulating endpoint logic.
- **Models/Data Objects:** PHP classes representing API objects (Agent, Tool, Source, etc.) for type safety and IDE support.
- **Response/Exception Handling:** Unified error and response management.
- **Configuration:** Centralized config for API base URL, token, etc.

## 3. Key Modules/Classes
- **Letta\Client**: Main entry point, manages configuration and exposes resource classes.
- **Letta\Http\HttpClient**: Handles HTTP requests, authentication, and low-level networking.
- **Letta\Resources\Agents**: Methods for all /v1/agents endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Tools**: Methods for all /v1/tools endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Sources**: Methods for all /v1/sources endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Groups**: Methods for all /v1/groups endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Identities**: Methods for all /v1/identities endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Models**: Methods for /v1/models endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Blocks**: Methods for /v1/blocks endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Tags**: Methods for /v1/tags endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Batches**: Methods for /v1/batches endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Voice**: Methods for /v1/voice endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Templates**: Methods for /v1/templates endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Providers**: Methods for /v1/providers endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Runs**: Methods for /v1/runs endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Steps**: Methods for /v1/steps endpoints.
- **Letta\Resources\Health**: Method for /v1/health endpoint.
- **Letta\Models\***: Data classes for Agent, Tool, Source, etc.
- **Letta\Exception\LettaException**: Base exception class for SDK errors.

## 4. Milestones and Deliverables
1. **Project Setup**
   - Composer package skeleton
   - PSR-4 autoloading
   - Initial README
2. **HTTP Client & Auth**
   - Implement HttpClient
   - Support for Bearer token
   - Error/response handling
3. **Core Resources**
   - Agents, Tools, Sources, Groups, Identities
   - Models for each resource
   - Unit tests for each
4. **Extended Resources**
   - Models, Blocks, Tags, Batches, Voice, Templates, Providers, Runs, Steps, Health
   - Models and tests
5. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Usage examples for each resource
   - API docs (PHPDoc)
   - README update
6. **Release**
   - Version 1.0.0 tag
   - Publish to Packagist

## 5. Testing and Documentation Strategy
- **Testing:**
  - PHPUnit for unit and integration tests
  - Mock HTTP responses for endpoint coverage
  - **Live integration tests against the production Letta server**
    - Use the self-hosted Letta server at `https://devletta.zero1.network:8283` for real API integration tests
    - Authentication password: `abc123` (ensure this is managed securely and not hardcoded in the repo, including adding this to a .gitignore)
    - Integration tests should be able to run locally and in CI (with credentials provided via environment variables or CI secrets)
    - **A dedicated test agent ID is available:** `agent-7ee90766-1b9b-443b-909c-ef88b54dda6c`
    - **Important:** Any temporary objects (agents, identities, blocks, etc.) created via the API during tests must be tracked so they can be cleaned up at the end of testing to avoid polluting the production environment.
    - CI integration (GitHub Actions or similar)
- **Documentation:**
  - PHPDoc for all public methods/classes
  - Markdown docs for usage and advanced topics
  - Example scripts for common use cases

## 6. Open Questions / Risks
- Are there any undocumented or unstable endpoints?
- How will breaking API changes be handled?
- Are there rate limits or special error codes to consider?
- Is async/streaming support required for all endpoints?
- What is the minimum PHP version to support?
- Will there be a need for middleware/hooks (e.g., for logging or custom retry logic)?

## Detailed Phased Checklist

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- [x] Review and finalize project plan with all stakeholders
- [x] Confirm API documentation is up to date and covers all endpoints
- [x] Define minimum supported PHP version
- [x] Set up version control and repository structure
- [x] Initialize Composer package and PSR-4 autoloading
- [x] Add `.gitignore` and ensure sensitive data (API keys, passwords) are excluded
- [x] Create initial README with project overview
- [x] **Negative Prompt:** Do NOT start coding SDK logic before the plan and architecture are approved

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Implement `Letta\Client` entry point
- [x] Implement `Letta\Http\HttpClient` with Bearer token support
- [x] Implement unified error/response handling
- [x] Add configuration management (base URL, token, etc.)
- [x] Set up base exception classes
- [x] **Negative Prompt:** Do NOT hardcode credentials or server URLs in code

### Phase 3: Core API Resources
- [x] Implement `Letta\Resources\Agents` (all endpoints)
- [x] Implement `Letta\Resources\Tools`
- [x] Implement `Letta\Resources\Sources`
- [x] Implement `Letta\Resources\Groups`
